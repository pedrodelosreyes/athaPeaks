# athaPeaks
Peak visualizer for Arabidopsis 


This script allows you to visualize peaks and dense binding profiles of TFs to the genome. It is born from the need to offer an automatable and customizable alternative to other viewers. As it is developed in R you can easily generate plots for many genes of interest.

This Peak visualizer is a tool developed from an ATTRACTOR (https://github.com/fran-romero-campero/ATTRACTOR)
and ALGAEFUN (https://github.com/fran-romero-campero/AlgaeFUN) module.
