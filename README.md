Peak visualizer for Arabidopsis 


<<<<<<< HEAD
This script allows you to visualize peaks (e.g. narrowPeak) and dense binding profiles (bwig) of TFs throughout the genome. It is born from the need to offer an automatable and customizable alternative to other viewers. As it is developed in R you can easily generate plots for many genes of interest.
